Package: python-decorator-dev
Version: 4.0.9-r0.0
Description: Python decorator utilities - Development files
 The aim of the decorator module it to simplify the usage of decorators
 for the average programmer, and to popularize decorators by showing
 various non-trivial examples. Of course, as all techniques, decorators
 can be abused and you should not try to solve every problem with a
 decorator, just because you can.  This package contains symbolic links,
 header files, and related items necessary for software development.
