.SH DESCRIPTION
The C/C++ ANSI Parser.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are accepted by this tool:
.SS Processor Options:
.SS
.TP
-v=0,1,2,3
Specify PRU version V0,V1,V2, or V3 When not specified by the user, the compiler defaults to 3
.SS Optimization Options:
.SS
.TP
-mf[=0-5]
Control speed vs. size trade-offs in optimization.  A value of 5 indicates fully optimizing for speed with a potentially large code size penalty, while a value of 0 indicates fully optimizing for size. Values between 0 and 5 indicate trade-offs between the two extremes. The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: 4
.TP
-O[=off,0,1,2,3,4]
Set compiler optimization level.

Level 0 includes register optimizations.  Level 1 adds local optimizations. Level 2 further adds global optimizations. Level 3 further adds interprocedure optimizations. Level 4 adds whole program optimizations. Level 4 must be passed to the linker for the optimizations to take affect. The argument to the option is optional, and if not specified it will default to: 2
.SS Include Options:
.SS
.TP
-I=dir
Add the specified dir(ectory) to the #include file search path list.
.TP
--preinclude=filename

.SS Control Options:
.SS
.TP
-c
Disable linking, overriding -z (if used).
.TP
-h
Show usage information.  When followed by another option or a phrase display that option's detailed information, or search for options related to that phrase.
.TP
-n
Compile only; do not assemble
.TP
-z[=arguments]
After compiling all the source files, perform a link and pass all the options following this option to the linker.
.SS Advanced Debug Options:
.SS
.TP
-g
Enable full symbolic DWARF debugging in the generated object or out file. [Same as -gw]
.TP

.SS Parser Preprocessing Options:
.SS
.TP
-ppa
This option instructs the compiler to additionally continue compilation of the source file (rather than exiting) after generating a pre-processing .pp output file such as those generated by -ppd (dependencies) -ppi (included files), or -ppm (macros).
